/**
 * An exported workflow, which is the type of a workflow constructed by the {@link createWorkflow} function. The exported workflow can be invoked to create
 * an executable workflow, optionally within a specified container. So, to execute the workflow, you must invoke the exported workflow, then run the
 * `run` method of the exported workflow.
 *
 * @example
 * To execute a workflow:
 *
 * ```ts
 * myWorkflow()
 *   .run({
 *     input: {
 *       name: "John"
 *     }
 *   })
 *   .then(({ result }) => {
 *     console.log(result)
 *   })
 * ```
 *
 * To specify the container of the workflow, you can pass it as an argument to the call of the exported workflow. This is necessary when executing the workflow
 * within a Medusa resource such as an API Route or a Subscriber.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import type {
 *   MedusaRequest,
 *   MedusaResponse
 * } from "@medusajs/medusa";
 * import myWorkflow from "../../../workflows/hello-world";
 *
 * export async function GET(
 *   req: MedusaRequest,
 *   res: MedusaResponse
 * ) {
 *   const { result } = await myWorkflow(req.scope)
 *     .run({
 *       input: {
 *         name: req.query.name as string
 *       }
 *     })
 *
 *   res.send(result)
 * }
 * ```
